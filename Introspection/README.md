<h2>Why we choose must you?</h2>
I'm really interested in web development and found that it would be best for me to join amFOSS and find similar people to me.<br>
I will give maximum effort to complete the tasks given to me

<h2>What is your plan for next 6 months?</h2>
I'm thinking about improving my HTML,CSS skills.<br>
Making my own personal webpage<br>

<h2>How would you contribute back to the club?</h2>
I will try to coordinate and help the members of the club and complete the tasks and quests given to me at my level best :)

<h2>Do you have any feedback for the selection process?</h2>
it was quite the long journey, mostly due to my procrastinating ;) <br>
But it was quite interesting, and i would say i learned a load of new stuff from it.
