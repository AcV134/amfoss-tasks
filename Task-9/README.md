<h1>Task-9</h1>
<h2>Spammer_Spaghetti</h2>

This was a fun task for me,but not for my friend ;) <br>
After googling around a little bit, i found it much easier to use classname id instead of id for telegram.So,my input was<br>

    document.getElementsByClassName('composer_rich_textarea')[0].innerHTML=message;
then,i found out about mousedown trigger from w3schools,<br>
    
    $('.im_submit').trigger('mousedown');	
and this was the result :)
